# Restaurant-Finder

Using the google maps api, users should be able to search in an input field for a particular location/area (example irvine) and be shown up to 10 restaurants of that area. This should be displayed in some sort of listing. In each listing record show the name of the restaurant, the rating of the restaurant, and the address of the restaurant. 
 
Example: User searches Irvine
 
Olive Garden    3.5    156 spectrum ave
Stonefire grill   3.0    175 olive grove ave
